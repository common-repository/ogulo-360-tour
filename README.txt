== Description ==

Any real estate brokerage, whether private or commercial, is a process characterized by an average of at least 80% idleness and - most importantly - inefficient mass viewing. This is mainly due to the fact that real estate is not mobile. A real absurdity in today's world! This is why we have made it our mission to provide estate agents and real estate agents with a simple and affordable tool that allows anyone to make real estate mobile in the form of a virtual tour. Ogulo mobilises estate agents and all other people involved in the mediation process (sellers, buyers, tenants and subcontractors) to free them from said inefficiencies.

Ogulo 360° tours allow your prospective buyers to have a complete insight into the property. This reduces unnecessary appointments and allows for greater flexibility in offering your property to your prospects.
